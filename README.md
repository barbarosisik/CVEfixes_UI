# CVEfixes_UI
To provide better observation ability and accessibility on the database, we developed a UI web application for the CVEfixes.db Database. Through our web application, filtering can be done in the commit, fixes, and cwe tables within the database, and visual charts can be accessed.

It is a UI web application where you can perform filtering on the CVEfixes.db database developed in the [CVEfixes](https://github.com/secureIT-project/CVEfixes) study.

We developed the web application for our Software & System Security course.
